## Overview

The "Rossmann Store Sales Prediction" notebook utilizes the XGBoost algorithm to forecast future sales for Rossmann stores. By analyzing historical sales data and various features related to the stores, the notebook aims to build an accurate predictive model for sales forecasting.

## Data

The dataset used in this notebook is from the Rossmann Store Sales competition on Kaggle. It includes the following key files:

- `train.csv`: Historical sales data for Rossmann stores.
- `test.csv`: Data for making predictions on store sales.
- `store.csv`: Information about the stores, including store features and metadata.

### Features

- `Store`: Store number
- `DayOfWeek`: Day of the week (1 = Monday, 7 = Sunday)
- `Date`: Date of the observation
- `Sales`: Sales for the day (target variable)
- `Customers`: Number of customers on that day
- `Open`: Whether the store was open or closed
- `Promo`: Whether a promotion was active
- `StateHoliday`: Whether a state holiday was observed
- `SchoolHoliday`: Whether a school holiday was observed
- `StoreType`: Type of store (A, B, C, or D)
- `Assortment`: Assortment level (a, b, c)
- `CompetitionDistance`: Distance to the nearest competitor
- `CompetitionOpenSinceMonth`: Month when the nearest competitor started
- `CompetitionOpenSinceYear`: Year when the nearest competitor started
- `Promo2`: Whether the store is participating in Promo2
- `Promo2SinceWeek`: Week when Promo2 started
- `Promo2SinceYear`: Year when Promo2 started
- `PromoInterval`: When Promo2 is active

## Dependencies

The notebook requires the following Python packages:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `xgboost`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
```

## Notebook Structure

The Jupyter Notebook is organized into the following sections:

1. **Introduction**: Overview of the project and objectives.
2. **Data Loading**: Importing and inspecting the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing and visualizing data to identify trends, patterns, and relationships.
5. **Feature Engineering**: Creating and selecting features that will be used for training the model.
6. **Model Building**:
   - **Splitting Data**: Dividing the dataset into training and validation sets.
   - **Training the Model**: Implementing and training the XGBoost model for sales prediction.
   - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model parameters for better performance using techniques such as RandomSearchCV.
7. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R^2 Score.
8. **Predictions**: Generating predictions for the test dataset and preparing results for submission.
9. **Results**: Presenting and interpreting the results, including model performance metrics and insights.
10. **Conclusion**: Summarizing findings and suggesting potential improvements or next steps.

## Usage

To run the notebook, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bilal-ahmad8/Data-Science-Portfolio.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory:

   ```bash
   cd Data-Science-Portfolio/Rossman\ Store\ Sales\ Prediction
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
